# Introduction ‚öìÔ∏è

Welcome to our lightweight and fun Go framework built on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This framework is designed to help developers quickly build web applications with a clean and maintainable structure, ensuring an enjoyable development experience.

## Features üöÄ

- MVC Architecture: Maintain a clean separation of concerns in your application.
- Hot-Reloading: Develop faster with real-time code reloading using Fresh.
- Docker Support: Easily build and run your application in a containerized environment.
- Swagger Integration: Automatically generate and view your API documentation.
- gRPC Support: Build high-performance microservices with gRPC. (Comming Soon)

## Instllation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with the framework, you have several options:

### Basic

Simply run the main.go file to start the application:

`go run main.go`

### Using Makefile

Alternatively, you can use the Makefile for convenience:
`make run`

### Hot-Reload with Fresh

The framework supports hot-reloading using Fresh. This allows you to see your changes in real-time without restarting the server. Use the following command:

`make hot`

## Unit Testing

To run unit tests, use Docker Compose. Note that unit testing can be tricky, and you might encounter errors. Here are the steps:

Run all tests using Makefile:

`make test-all`

Or, manually run tests inside the Docker container:

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec gptv_backend go test -v ./...
```

Every time you run **make hot** the swagger files will be regenared

## Docker

For development purposes, you can build and run the Docker image with hot reload using Fresh.

### Building

```shell
docker compose -f "docker-compose.dev.yml"  build
```

Run the dockers:

```shell
docker compose -f "docker-compose.dev.yml"  up
```

## Swagger

The framework includes integrated Swagger support for API documentation. You can access the Swagger UI at:

<http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html>

This makes it easy to explore and test your API endpoints interactively.
